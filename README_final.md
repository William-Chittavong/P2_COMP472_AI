Instructions:

1. Open Anaconda prompt

2. Have the text file with the games and P2_final.ipynb in the same directory.

3. Make sure to have 2 folders called "searches" and "sols" in the same directory as the

the "sols" folder.
4. Call the get_lines method where it accepts as parameters the name of the input file
with all of the games as well as a list of the algorithms represented by the functions.
